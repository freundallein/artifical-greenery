# artificial-greenery
UPDATE.
Destop version is not good enough if you RPi doesn't have some touchscreen,

so csver branch introduces client-server version of Artificial greenery Control.


Little desktop program for controlling Artificial Greenery

Artificial Greenery based on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian on board and 2 IKEA boxes.
Uses DHT11 sensor, not good enough, but cheap.

For work you need to install PyQt4 and Adafruit Driver for DHT-sensors.
